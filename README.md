# terminus1.9
There should be no previous installation of Terminus when using this version of Terminus 1.9. Ideally used in a CI/CD instance where you can git clone this installation.

1) Copy file in the home
2) Run composer install using these files should make terminus work
3) Make sure the the vendor and the .terminus folders are intact as the same copy as this repo
