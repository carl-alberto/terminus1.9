Terminus Plugin to run [Drupal Console](https://github.com/hechoendrupal/DrupalConsole) commands on [Pantheon](https://www.pantheon.io) sites.

Adds a command 'drupal' to Terminus 1.x which you can use just like 'drush' or 'wp'. For a version that works with Terminus 0.x, see the [0.x branch](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-drupal-console-plugin/tree/0.x).

This project is based on the `drush` and `wp` commands from Terminus core.

## Configuration

In order for the Terminus Drupal Console plugin to work, you must add Drupal Console to your Drupal site.  Drupal Console is already included if you are using the [Example Drops-8 Composer repository](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/example-drops-8-composer) (recommended).

## Examples
